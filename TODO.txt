Questions:

1) how to access methods in Traits such as MaybeTFunctions

A: See, who extends this trait. Usually all of these funcitons are gathered in one object.
F.e:    object MaybeT extends MaybeTFunctions

2) look for >>= and lifts.
A: Looks like I have to write them myself.. >>= a hidden behind private access.
